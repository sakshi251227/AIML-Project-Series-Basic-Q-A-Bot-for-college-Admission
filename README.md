**Basic Q&A Bot for College Admission**
**1. Admission-Related Q&A**
Core Functionality
The chatbot should be able to answer common questions related to college admissions, including procedures, requirements, and deadlines.
**2. User Interaction**
Engaging Conversation Flow
The chatbot should facilitate a conversation where users can ask multiple questions in a single session.

Memory Mechanism
To enhance the chatbot's ability to remember previous interactions, we can store user queries and responses in a list.
**4. Connection to Backend **
Integration with a Backend System
For real-time information, you could connect the chatbot to a backend API that provides up-to-date admission information. This requires a more advanced setup, including a web framework and database.
**5. Error Handling and Feedback**
Robust Error Handling
Implement error handling to address unrecognized queries.

**Conclusion**
This project provides a solid foundation for a college admission chatbot. It includes admission-related Q&A, user interaction, contextual understanding, and error handling.
